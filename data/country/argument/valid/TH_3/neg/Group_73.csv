It is clear that the debate on the Future of Europe should also open the question of the future role of the European Parliament. 	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	2.5288312264360164
4056	We should promote mental health	in favor of	A psychological examination should be part of child screening, together with counseling to parents (e.g. dealing with children’s own concerns and fears, or increasing self-confidence among children and parents). It would also make it easier to protect children from violence, for example by overwhelming them, or to recognize them in the home and learn from the outset how to take care of their mental health. 	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	2.9410345974717234
4059	We should stop daylight saving time change	against	Imposing the time change allows having more hours of light in summer, which gives an energy saving. I know that some studies say that savings would be minimal, but we must consider the growing European energy dependence on photovoltaics: We humans consume more electricity when we are awake, the photovoltaic gives a good availability of energy but only during the day and is difficult to store, to overlap the moment of energy availability given by photovoltaics (the hours of light) with the moment in which citizens have the most energy needs I think it can eventually save more energy in the future.	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	2.367819915724107

4103	We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.	in favor of	We would have to change asylum rules. Illegal immigrants will claim asylum after entering the country to attempt to make their entry legal. It then becomes a massive pain to deport them. Illegal entries must result in an automatic rejection of asylum claims.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2.3705921490352626
4104	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries 	in favor of	We need single and selective migration rules. It is very challenging for Europe to protect its border without harming refugees or financial migrants fleeing their countries, and it cannot be efficient without unified and powerful border security (Frontex). 	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	2.950016633399867
4106	We should stop integration.	in favor of	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'.	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	2.5291084497671323

Today it is very easy to be anonymous, but hard to prove the identity of opinion and establish a public web of trust.  Anonymity enables powerful identities to control the messages, and therefore the identity-seeking masses. 	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	2.6163229097360836
