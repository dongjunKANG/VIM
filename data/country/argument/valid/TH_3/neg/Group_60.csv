4059	We should stop daylight saving time change	against	Imposing the time change allows having more hours of light in summer, which gives an energy saving. I know that some studies say that savings would be minimal, but we must consider the growing European energy dependence on photovoltaics: We humans consume more electricity when we are awake, the photovoltaic gives a good availability of energy but only during the day and is difficult to store, to overlap the moment of energy availability given by photovoltaics (the hours of light) with the moment in which citizens have the most energy needs I think it can eventually save more energy in the future.	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1.8166081871345028

Several scientific and health organizations already published statements to speak up for at least permanent standard time and warn about the health implications of permanent or seasonal daylight saving time. And there is plenty more to list. Education suffers from Daylight Saving Time as much as the Economy, mainly because of productivity loss due to chronic sleep deprivation and disturbances and the increase in health costs.	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	2.340912280701754
