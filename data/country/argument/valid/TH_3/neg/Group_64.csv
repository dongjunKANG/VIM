If anyone hears the name for the first time, he/she will think that this approach requires no investment. But it requires investment to spend on labor, cow maintenance, and water. The costs are very low when compared with other forms of agriculture, but it is not completely zero. To avoid this confusion, ZBNF was renamed as Subhash Palekar Natural Farming (SPNF). But, it was announced as ZBNF in the budget 2019.	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	2.8427102238354505

Unfortunately, old-fashioned policies have made things very complicated. Wherever energy cooperations can play their part, things become much easier and more cost-effective. If big companies have to deliver it all alone, things become difficult, complicated, and costly, because their structures make it difficult to provide sophisticated setups for communities of small consumers.	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	2.898517846339988
