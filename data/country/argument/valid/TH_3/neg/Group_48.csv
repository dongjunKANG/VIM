Unfortunately, old-fashioned policies have made things very complicated. Wherever energy cooperations can play their part, things become much easier and more cost-effective. If big companies have to deliver it all alone, things become difficult, complicated, and costly, because their structures make it difficult to provide sophisticated setups for communities of small consumers.	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1.9266078838174274
