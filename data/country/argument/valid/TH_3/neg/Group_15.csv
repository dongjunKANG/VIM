Lukashenka launched a hybrid attack on the EU when he organized and directed mass migration to Europe's borders. George Soros and his NGOs did the exact same thing. When it is they who organize and direct mass migration they are also engaged in a hybrid assault on Europe.  The organization of migration is a crime against humanity. Gangsters like Lukashenka and Soros should be held accountable! 	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	2.3339977220956722
