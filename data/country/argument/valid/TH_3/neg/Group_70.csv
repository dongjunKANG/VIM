4068	We should legalize non-violent drug use	in favor of	The 'War on Drugs' gifted to us by the USA is absolute rubbish. Sugar is more dangerous than Cannabis! How many people have died on 'legal highs'? FAR too many. The death toll from Cannabis use = 0. More lives have been destroyed by drug laws than the drugs themselves. Besides, Cannabis is an herb, not a drug. Many herbs have medicinal properties. If any becomes a health issue, that's how it needs to be addressed, as a health problem, not a crime!	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	2.5896100427350426
4082	We should legalize non-violent drug use	in favor of	European institutions should take factual studies of the relative harm of different drugs into account.
