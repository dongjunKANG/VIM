4060	We should stop daylight saving time change	in favor of	 All countries should get back to their geographically correct time zone. It is in public often discussed as a matter of preference. But public health cannot be decided by inquiries about people's preferences. Several scientific and health organizations already published statements to speak up for at least permanent standard time and warn about the health implications of permanent or seasonal daylight saving time. And there is plenty more to list. Education suffers from Daylight Saving Time as much as the Economy, mainly because of productivity loss due to chronic sleep deprivation and disturbances and the increase in health costs.	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	2.6623979912115496
