It is clear that the debate on the Future of Europe should also open the question of the future role of the European Parliament. 	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1.9443443443443442

When it is they who organize and direct mass migration they are also engaged in a hybrid assault on Europe.  The organization of migration is a crime against humanity.
