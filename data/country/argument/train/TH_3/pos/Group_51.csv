2877	Public transport in EU cities should be free	in favor of	I think a very good transportation system within European cities is very much desirable. There is not enough space for many parking lots anyway, electro-cars won't be able to replace common cars, and urban spaces have to become greener.  In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and, hopefully, appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	3.3492279745685742
