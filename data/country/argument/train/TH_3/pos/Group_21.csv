It is an illusion that the smuggling of such drugs can be controlled. Billions of euros have been spent trying to combat smuggling but have not reduced the supply of such drugs. Legalization of the least harmful drugs will allow the quality of the drugs to be controlled (hence reducing harm); reduce exposure to more harmful drugs (because dealers currently introduce users of soft drugs to harder drugs), and cut out a significant source of drug dealer revenues.	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	3.2695945945945946

This lawlessness on the part of federalist institutions must stop with immediate effect, and we must reaffirm the principles of subsidiarity and conferral. 	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	3.1207207207207204
