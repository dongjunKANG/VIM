So, the solution lies in encouraging education for girls, conducting awareness programs on the importance of education, financial independence and the consequences of teenage pregnancies should be conducted instead of passing a law to bring a real change in society.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	3.2399150743099785
